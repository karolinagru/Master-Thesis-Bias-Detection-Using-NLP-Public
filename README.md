# "Detection of Social Biases in the Real Estate Market in Germany Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Techniques"

Social discrimination on social media platforms and online marketplaces demands control for prejudicial treatment. At the same time, the increasing number of open-source Machine Learning models and availability of large datasets motivates new methods to analyse the users’ behaviour. This thesis applies transformers-based models to detect social biases in the German housing market. The realtors’ response to a seeker’s enquiry is predicted based on the message, accompanied by the additional information on the seekers and the realtors. Interpreting the learned models, we observe a difference in the prediction quality concerning characteristics of the seeker such as groups of age, income, employment, marital status and nationalities. The variation in the models’ output is interpreted as an implicit social bias of the realtors in our dataset.
